I develop cross-platform apps and websites. I have developed 3 android apps and published them on the Play Store, one of them is Just Meet with thousands of daily users. I have been coding from class 8 and have gained 3 years of experience with flutter language and android app development.
I am a student of class 10 presently, I study all day and code at night. I believe in developing free or low-cost high-quality premium apps available to all the people of India. 

Recently I developed Just Meet, a video conferencing app that gives complete privacy, is secured and end to end encrypted, uses lesser data and battery, and works well in bad network areas like a charm and the best thing is it has no restriction on the number of participants or meeting duration and that too completely free!  As I code alone it took me about 3 months to complete the initial release of it. It has a lot of features, some are new and very helpful. I believe this app will help a lot of people save their money and continue their meetings even in the worst network peacefully without having the tension of their user data!

I have experience working on Firebase, Adsense, Admob, Facebook Audience Network, Unity Ads, etc, and also little in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AIML.

When am not studying and frustrated with bugs and errors usually spend my time working out on my muscles, painting, and playing with my pet dog "Ani".
